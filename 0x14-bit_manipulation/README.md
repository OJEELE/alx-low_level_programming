Task 0.0 Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

    Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
    where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
    Return: the converted number, or 0 if
        there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
        b is NULL
Task 1.1 . a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

TAsk 2.10.  a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Task 3.11 a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Task 4.100 a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Task 5.101 a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Task 6 a function that checks the endianness.

Task 7 the password for this program
